What does it do?
================

The extension provides a button in the :ref:`TYPO3 Admin Panel
<typo3/cms-adminpanel:introduction>` to jump directly from the frontend page to the
corresponding backend form. This eliminates the need to click through the page
tree to edit a page.

The user's access rights are taken into account - so if they do not have
permission to edit a page, the :guilabel:`Edit` section is not available.
