# TYPO3 Extension: Go To Backend

> Since TYPO3 v12.0 this feature was added to the admin panel directly. So there is no need
> for a v12 compatible version of this extension:
> [Open backend page from admin panel](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/main/en-us/Changelog/12.0/Feature-97326-OpenBackendPageFromAdminPanel.html)

Add a button in Admin Panel to jump from a frontend page into the according backend area.

The extension supports TYPO3 v10 LTS and TYPO3 v11 LTS.
